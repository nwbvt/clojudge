# clojudge

A library for validation

## Usage

Validation functions can consist of functions that, based on their single input, return either
 -a boolean indicating whether or not the input is valid
 -a list of error messages (an empty list indicates the input is valid)
 -a map containing the keys :valid? (a boolean indicating validity) and :errors (the error list)
 -anything implementing the clojudge.core.Result protocol

Judges can be either one of these validation fucntions or a list of said functions
For lists, the input will be valid iff it is valid for each member

Then for some judge j
(judge j input)
will return a clojudge.core.Result indicating the validity and errors
